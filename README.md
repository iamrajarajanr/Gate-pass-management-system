GPMS provides an easy method for the front desk officer to
 search the ongoing visitor of the day. They will be timely
 notified of the current visitor visiting their department.
 Searching method is also faster and the system will give output
 that user needs. Currently, most organization is using the
 named method in keeping track all the incoming and out going
 visitor records in each of the department. Problem raised when
 at curtain point of time the number of visitor visiting the
 department increasing and unable to manage and messed up.
 On top of that, a security issue also is the main issues in
 generating visitor pass in that particular organization. VGMS
 also helps user access information inquiry faster. Compared to
 the manually system, user need to go page by page to search
 information. Imagine there was hundreds of visitor coming in
 and out. However, with the new system, user only need to
 search via card number and as a result, the system will display
 related output that been entered by the user earlier. Problem
 such as waiting for a long time queue will be no more an
 problem and will give an impression of well-organized system
